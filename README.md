 - Decreasing count of spam messages

#### Main features

  - Deleting comments that don't have fast growth of likes enougth
  - Asynchronous refreshing of list of existing comments
  - Easy connection: administrator of public just have to give to wall controller [vk account](https://vk.com/controllerbot) permisions for moderating (it's safe: moderator can't delete anything except comments) in his community.
